## Getting Started

Before diving in, take a look at the setup guide in our [README.md](/README.md) file to ensure you have a development environment set up and ready to go.

## Contributing Guidelines

- Coding Style:

  We use Prettier for code formatting. The configuration file is located within the repository [here](/.prettierrc) to ensure consistency. For naming conventions, we follow CamelCase for variables and functions, and use hyphens (-) in folder names to represent spaces (e.g., my-awesome-feature).

- Code Reviews:

  All pull requests will require a code review before being merged. This helps ensure the quality and consistency of the codebase.

- Unit Testing (Optional):

  While we don't currently enforce unit tests, we encourage you to include them whenever possible. This helps ensure the functionality of your contribution and aids in future maintenance.
